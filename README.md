# @ucl_wiki_edits
UCL edits monitors the [Wikipedia Recent Changes Stream](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Recent_changes_stream) for any edits made anonymously on campus at UCL, and tweets them.
Inspired by Evan Bernstein's [@Uchicago_edits](https://github.com/eeevanbbb/UChicago_Edits), and Ed Summers' [anon script](https://github.com/edsu/anon).
